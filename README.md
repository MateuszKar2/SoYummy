 # SoYummy

**SoYummy** is a food-related web application that allows users to discover, search, and explore various recipes. It is a collaborative project that I am working on with a colleague to deepen our understanding of web development, particularly in the areas of front-end technologies and API integration.

Currently, the project is still under development, but we are working towards creating a user-friendly platform where users can easily find new meal ideas, save their favorite recipes, and explore detailed information about ingredients, cooking methods, and more.
